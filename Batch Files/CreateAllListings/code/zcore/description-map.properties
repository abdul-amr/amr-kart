Transplanting should be done together with the existing pot ground, and must be staked immediately. The plants will produce fast with flower buds; when they feel stable and secured.

PETUNIA=Mix Agro peat or Manure with soil (30:70), this will help in germination of seeds. Care needs to be taken to see that the soil is clean from any weed or insect. Now open the seed packet on a white sheet of paper as while opening the seeds might fall, which are not visible to naked eyes. After preparing the soil, insert the seeds into the prepared to half (0.5) inch of depth. While watering, care needs to be taken to only sprinkling water through a sprinkler or manually using your hands, do not use pipe or a mug to water for the first week, as the force of water might damage the seed germination process. Germination may take place 10-18 days, depending upon different varieties. Once the seeds grow in to seedlings, say around 3 inches, then you may transplant the seedlings to various pots or desired areas. The sapling needs to be checked at regular intervals to ensure it is not infected by any weed/pest or insect and if you find any such thing on the leaves or in soil then you may spray Organic Pestisides on it. Use Creative Farmer- Organic Manure once in 15 days for the growth of the Flower/Vegetable/Herb plants. Happy Gardening!
